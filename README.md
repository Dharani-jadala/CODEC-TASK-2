CI/CD Pipeline Setup Overview

This repository implements a Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying applications. The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality, faster delivery, and reliable deployment by automating repetitive tasks such as building the code, running tests, and pushing changes to production.

Key Features of the CI/CD Pipeline

1. Continuous Integration (CI)

Automatically builds the code and runs unit tests whenever new code is pushed to the repository.

Includes static code analysis to check for code quality and security issues.



2. Automated Testing

Unit tests are executed automatically to verify the functionality of the application.

Integration and end-to-end tests can be triggered to validate application behavior in real-world scenarios.



3. Continuous Delivery (CD)

Automatically deploys the application to different environments such as Development, Staging, and Production.

Supports Docker-based deployment, Kubernetes, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible environments.



4. Monitoring and Notifications

Continuous monitoring of deployed applications to track their health and performance.

Integration with Slack, Teams, or email for build and deployment status notifications.




Tools and Technologies Used

Version Control: Git (GitHub)

CI/CD Automation: Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI

Build Tools: Maven, Gradle, npm

Testing Frameworks: JUnit, Selenium, PyTest

Deployment Tools: Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana

Notification: Slack, Email


Workflow Overview

1. Code Push: Developers push code to the Git repository.


2. Build: The CI pipeline is triggered to build the application and run unit tests.


3. Test: Automated testing (unit, integration) is performed.


4. Deploy: The CD pipeline deploys the application to the appropriate environment.


5. Monitor: Deployed applications are continuously monitored for performance.



This CI/CD pipeline ensures that the development process is streamlined, allowing teams to deliver high-quality software quickly and reliably.
